    Return the ray paths between pairs of vertices, that reflect or diffract on a given list of objects in between.

    Linear objects are defined by a linear combination of zero or more (possibly orthogonal) vectors,
    plus a point in space (i.e., the origin).

    E.g., a straight line can be defined by a point and a direction vector,
    while a plane can be defined by a point and two orthogonal direction vectors.

    Because the size of ``object_vectors`` is determined by the object with the most dimensions,
    objects with fewer dimensions should have the extra vectors set to zero.

    Based on the Fermat principle, this method finds the ray paths
    between the ``from`` and ``to`` vertices, that minimize the total length of the paths.

    While the method assumes that the objects are infinite, as for the
    :func:`image method<differt.rt.image_method>`, choosing an appropriate origin can be important
    as it will be used as the initial point of the minimization procedure.

    .. important::

        The current implementation uses the ``fpt-jax`` library
        :cite:`fpt-eucap2026`, which defines :class:`jax.custom_vjp` functions for more
        efficient gradient computations, see the paper for more details. The implementation
        is not guaranteed to converge for all configurations of vertices and objects,
        and the user may need to tune the number of steps to achieve convergence.

    Args:
        from_vertices: An array of ``from`` vertices, i.e., vertices from which the
            ray paths start. In a radio communications context, this is usually
            an array of transmitters.
        to_vertices: An array of ``to`` vertices, i.e., vertices to which the
            ray paths end. In a radio communications context, this is usually
            an array of receivers.
        object_origins: An array of object origins.

            It is used as the initial guess of the minimization procedure.
        object_vectors: An array of base vectors describing the objects.
        steps: The number of optimization steps to perform.
        unroll: Whether to unroll the optimization loop. Can be a boolean or an integer
            specifying the number of iterations to unroll, see :func:`jax.lax.scan`.
        linesearch_steps: The number of line search steps to perform at each iteration.
        unroll_linesearch: Whether to unroll the line search loop. Can be a boolean or an integer
            specifying the number of iterations to unroll, see :func:`jax.lax.scan`.
        implicit_diff: Whether to use implicit differentiation for computing the gradient.
            See :cite:`fpt-eucap2026` and its
            `GitHub page <https://github.com/jeertmans/fpt-jax/tree/v0.1.0>`_ for more details.

    Returns:
        An array of ray paths obtained based on Fermat's principle.

    .. note::

        The paths do not contain the starting and ending vertices.

        You can easily create the complete ray paths using
        :func:`assemble_paths<differt.geometry.assemble_paths>`:

        .. code-block:: python

            paths = fermat_path_on_linear_objects(...)

            full_paths = assemble_paths(
                from_vertices,
                paths,
                to_vertices,
            )

    Examples:
        The following example shows how to use this method to find the ray paths
        undergoing a diffraction on the edge of a wall, then a reflection on a mirror,
        before reaching the receiver.
