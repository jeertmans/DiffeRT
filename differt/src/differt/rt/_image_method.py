    Return the ray paths between pairs of vertices, that reflect on a given list of mirrors in between.

    The Image Method is a very simple but effective path tracing technique
    that can rapidly compute a ray path undergoing a series
    of specular reflections on a pre-defined list of mirrors.

    The method assumes infinitely long mirrors, and will return invalid
    paths in some degenerated cases such as consecutive colinear mirrors,
    or impossible configurations. It is the user's responsibility to make
    sure that the returned path is correct.

    Otherwise, the returned path will, for each reflection, have equal angles
    of incidence and of reflection.

    Warning:
        NaNs and infinity values should be treated as invalid paths, and will naturally
        occur when image paths are impossible to trace, e.g., when a mirror
        is parallel to a ray segment that it is supposed to reflect.

    Args:
        from_vertices: An array of ``from`` vertices, i.e., vertices from which the
            ray paths start. In a radio communications context, this is usually
            an array of transmitters.
        to_vertices: An array of ``to`` vertices, i.e., vertices to which the
            ray paths end. In a radio communications context, this is usually
            an array of receivers.
        mirror_vertices: An array of mirror vertices. For each mirror, any
            vertex on the infinite plane that describes the mirror is considered
            to be a valid vertex.
        mirror_normals: An array of mirror normals, where each normal has a unit
            length and if perpendicular to the corresponding mirror.

    Returns:
        An array of ray paths obtained with the image method.

    .. note::

        The paths do not contain the starting and ending vertices.

        You can easily create the complete ray paths using
        :func:`assemble_paths<differt.geometry.assemble_paths>`:

        .. code-block:: python

            paths = image_method(
                from_vertices,
                to_vertices,
                mirror_vertices,
                mirror_normals,
            )

            full_paths = assemble_paths(
                from_vertices[..., None, :],
                paths,
                to_vertices[..., None, :],
            )

    Examples:
        The following image shows how the Image Method (IM) can be applied
        to find a path between two nodes (i.e., BS and UE).

        .. figure:: ../../_static/image-method.svg
            :width: 70%
            :align: center
            :alt: Image Method example.

            Example application of IM in RT. The method determines the only
            valid path that can be taken to join BS and UE with, in between, reflection with
            two mirrors (the interaction order is important). First, the consecutive images
            of the BS are determined through each mirror, using line symmetry. Second,
            intersections with mirrors are computed backward, `i.e.`, from last mirror to
            first, by joining the UE, then the intersections points, with the images of the
            BS. Finally, the valid path can be obtained by joining BS, the intermediary
            intersection points, and the UE :cite:`mpt-eucap2023{fig. 5}`.

        Next, we show how to reproduce the above results using :func:`image_method`.
