    "\n",
    "In a previous work {cite}`fully-eucap2024`, we introduce a smoothing technique that aims\n",
    "at smoothing the discontinuities caused by Ray Tracing in the hope to make optimization\n",
    "through gradient descent easier. This technique was originally implemented in {cite}`differt2d`,\n",
    "and we now aim to reproduce a similar implementation inside DiffeRT, but with less flexibility to\n",
    "reduce code complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not go into details of how the method actually work, nor the actual implementation details,\n",

    "In practice, additional constraints are imposed to {math}`s`, but they are not detailed here.\n",

    "\n",
    "Currently, only a limited set of functions allow returning a *smoothed-out* value\n",
