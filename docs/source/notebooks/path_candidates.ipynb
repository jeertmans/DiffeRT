    "# Generating path candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing deterministic, or exact, Ray Tracing, we aim at exactly finding all possibles paths\n",
    "between two nodes (e.g., BS and UE) that undergo up to a fixed number of interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, a possible approach, as described in {cite}`mpt-eucap2023`, is to first\n",
    "generate a set of path candidates. Each path candidate represent an ordered list of interactions\n",
    "with the environment. Then, a coordinates path will be computed for every path candidate using,\n",
    "e.g., the {func}`image_method<differt.rt.image_method.image_method>`,\n",
    "see [Advanced Path Tracing](advanced_path_tracing.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Listing those path candidates is equivalent to finding all the paths from BS to UE in a graph that\n",
    "connects nodes and objects together.\n",

    "## Scene with known visibility matrix\n",

    "**without intersecting any other object in the scene**. If we omit the start and end nodes,\n",
    "usually denoting transmitters and receivers, respectively, the matrix should be symmetric.\n",

    "We can construct a directed graph {cite}`directed-graph` ({class}`DiGraph<differt.rt.graph.DiGraph>`) from this matrix\n",
