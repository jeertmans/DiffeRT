    "When performing deterministic, or exact, Ray Tracing, we aim at exactly finding all possibles paths\n",

    "\n",
    "To this end, a possible approach, as described in {cite}`mpt-eucap2023`, is to first\n",
    "generate a set of path candidates. Each path candidate represent an ordered list of interactions\n",
    "with the environment. Then, a coordinates path will be computed for every path candidate using,\n",
    "e.g., the {func}`image_method<differt.rt.image_method.image_method>`,\n",
    "see [Advanced Path Tracing](advanced_path_tracing.ipynb).\n",
