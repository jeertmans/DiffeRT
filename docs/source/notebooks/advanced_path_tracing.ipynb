    "\n",
    "One way to generate all possible paths is to represent the problem as a graph. Then, the goal is to find all the paths from the node corresponding to TX, to the node corresponding to RX, while possibly visiting intermediate nodes in the graph, where each corresponds to a specific primitive in the scene (here, a triangle).\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph algorithm will therefore generate a list of *path candidates*. We use the word *candidate* to emphasize that this is not a real path (i.e., not 3D coordinates), but only an ordered list of nodes to visit, for a given path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, this is the role of the **path finding** method (e.g., {func}`image_method<differt.rt.image_method.image_method>` or {func}`fermat_path_on_planar_mirrors<differt.rt.fermat.fermat_path_on_planar_mirrors>`) to find the exact coordinates of that path.\n",
