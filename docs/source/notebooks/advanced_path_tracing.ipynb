    "One way to generate all possible paths is to represent the problem as a graph. Then, the goal is to find all the paths from the node corresponding to TX, to the node corresponding to RX, while possibly visiting intermediate nodes in the graph, where each corresponds to a specific primitive—or object—in the scene (here, a triangle).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, this is the role of the **path tracing** method (e.g., {func}`image_method<differt.rt.image_method.image_method>` or {func}`fermat_path_on_planar_mirrors<differt.rt.fermat.fermat_path_on_planar_mirrors>`) to determine the exact coordinates of that path.\n",
