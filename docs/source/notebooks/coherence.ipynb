    "# Coherent vs. Non-Coherent Radio Wave Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modeling of electromagnetic wave propagation—particularly in ray-based methods—a critical distinction must be made between **coherent** and **non-coherent** propagation models. This section outlines the theoretical and practical implications of each approach, providing guidance for their appropriate use and referencing relevant scientific literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coherent Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coherent propagation** refers to modeling techniques that preserve the **phase** of the electromagnetic fields. In such models, the total received signal is calculated as the **vector sum** of the complex amplitudes of all contributing multipath components. This approach captures both **constructive and destructive interference**, enabling the accurate representation of small-scale fading and phase-dependent phenomena such as beamforming {cite}`dynrt-largeurban,rt-review,vitucciDiscreteEnvironmentDrivenGPUBased2021`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the received power $P$ in a coherent model is often expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = A_e \\left\\|\\boldsymbol{S}\\right\\| = A_e \\left\\| \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i} \\boldsymbol{E}_i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i} \\boldsymbol{B}_i\\right) \\right\\|,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A_e$ is the effective antenna aperture, $\\boldsymbol{S}$ is the Poynting vector, $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability, and $\\boldsymbol{E}_i$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}_i$ denote the electric and magnetic fields of the $i$-th propagation path, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the phase of both fields varies very rapidly—at the scale of the wavelength—and the geometric accuracy of most modeled scenes (especially in urban environments) is limited, accounting for the actual field phase can become counterproductive. It may introduce interference patterns that would not realistically occur due to measurement noise or geometric uncertainty. Moreover, simulating the exact $\\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}$ fields can be complex, particularly when including polarization effects, as antennas are often modeled using only a radiation pattern and polarization vector. For these reasons, among others, a non-coherent approach is often preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Coherent Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **non-coherent** propagation models assume that the phase of individual multipath components is either unknown, random, or irrelevant {cite}`yunRayTracingRadio2015`. Consequently, the received signal is computed as a **power sum** rather than a complex vector sum. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity and avoids the numerical sensitivity associated with fine-scale geometric or frequency variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total received power $P$ is typically given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\sum\\limits_{i} P_i = \\sum\\limits_{i} A_e \\left\\|\\boldsymbol{S}_i\\right\\| = \\sum\\limits_{i} A_e \\left\\| \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\boldsymbol{E}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{B}_i \\right\\|,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_i$ represents the power from the $i$-th ray, computed independently of phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing the Two Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we compare the **coherent** and **non-coherent** methods by generating a coverage map of the received power in a very simple scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import a few packages, but the cell is hidden by default to increase readability."
