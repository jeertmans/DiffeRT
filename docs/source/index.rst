DiffeRT: Differentiable Ray Tracing Toolbox for Radio Propagation
=================================================================

DiffeRT is a Python module that aims to make *Differentiable Ray Tracing* accessible
to researchers in radio propagation!

It is currently developed as part of a PhD, but a lot of work is put into documentating and
testing the tool, so any researcher should be able to understand how to use this tool for
their own research.

As mentioned on the GitHub page, the current state of the project is still considered to
be under *high-development*, and we welcome any contribution!
