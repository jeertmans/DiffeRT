    Generate an array of all path candidates for fixed path order
    and a number of primitives.

    The returned array contains, for each column, an array of
    ``order`` indices indicating the primitive with which the path interacts.

    This list is generated as the list of all paths from one node to
    another, by passing by exactly ``order`` primitives. Calling this function
    is equivalent to calling :func:`itertools.product` with parameters
    ``[0, 1, ..., num_primitives - 1]`` and ``repeat=order``, and removing entries
    with containing loops, i.e., two or more consecutive indices that are equal.

    Args:
        num_primitives: The (positive) number of primitives.
        order: The path order. An order less than one returns an empty array.

    Returns:
        An unsigned array with primitive indices on each columns. Its number of
        columns is actually equal to
        ``num_primitives * ((num_primitives - 1) ** (order - 1))``.

    Return whether rays intersect corresponding triangles using the
    MÃ¶ller-Trumbore algorithm.

    The current implementation closely follows the C++ code from Wikipedia.

    Args:
        ray_origins: An array of origin vertices.
        ray_directions: An array of ray direction. The ray ends
            should be equal to ``ray_origins + ray_directions``.
        triangle_vertices: An array of triangle vertices.
        epsilon: A small tolerance threshold that allows rays
            to hit the triangles slightly outside the actual area.
            A positive value virtually increases the size of the triangles,
            a negative value will have the opposite effect.

            Such a tolerance is especially useful when rays are hitting
            triangle edges, a very common case if geometries are planes
            split into multiple triangles.

    Returns:
        For each ray, return the scale factor of ``ray_directions`` for the
        vector to reach the corresponding triangle, and whether the intersection
        actually lies inside the triangle.
